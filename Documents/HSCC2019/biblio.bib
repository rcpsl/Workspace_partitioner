   abstract = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPys syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPys syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6 to 7.5 faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5 and 44 faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}

    Abstract = {Specification is the first and arguably the most important step for formal verification and correct-by-construction synthesis. It is extremely difficult to manually create a complete suite of good-quality formal specifications. Many real-world experiences indicate that poor or the lack of sufficient specifications can easily lead to misses of critical bugs, and in turn design re-spins and time-to-market slips. This dissertation presents research that seeks to mitigate the manual and error-prone process of creating formal specifications through automation. The overarching theme is specification mining - the process of inferring likely specifications by observing a design's behaviors. We explore novel formalisms and algorithms to mine specifications from different sources, and demonstrate that the mined specifications are useful if not essential for a wide variety of applications such as verification, diagnosis and LTL synthesis. Further, we describe efforts on broadening the scope of specification mining with creative use of human inputs, including the design of a crowdsourced game and judicious use of natural language processing techniques.}

The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPys syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and
functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates
them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6 to 7.5 faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the
CPU and between 6.5 and 44 faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.}
